## Challenges Faced

Building this e-commerce website came with several challenges that required problem-solving and learning new skills:

1. **Handling State Management**: Managing the state for the shopping cart across different components was tricky. I used **React Context API** to centralize state management and make it easily accessible across the application. This solution helped keep the app scalable and maintainable.
2. **Creating a Responsive Layout**: Ensuring the website was fully responsive across devices was challenging, especially with dynamic content like product grids and the cart. 
3. **Backend Integration**: Connecting the frontend with a backend to manage product data, handle transactions, and manage user sessions posed its own set of challenges. I had to ensure secure APIs were in place and that the frontend could communicate efficiently with the backend using **Axios** for HTTP requests.
